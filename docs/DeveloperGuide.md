## Design

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***architecture diagram*** given above is explains the high level design of the program.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of architecture**

`BrokeMan` has one class [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/brokeMan/BrokeMan.java), which is responsible for:
- At program launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connect them up with each other
- At program termination: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[`Common`](#common-class) represents a collection of messages used by multiple other components.

The rest of the program consists of mainly 5 main components.
- [`Ui`](#ui-component): The Ui of the program.
- [`Parser`](#parser-component): The user input parser.
- [`Command`](#command-component): The command executor.
- [`Storage`](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to hard disk.
- [`EntryList`](#entrylist-component): Stores the list of entries when program is running.

### Ui component

### Parser component

### Command component

### Storage component

### EntryList component

### Common class

Messages used by multiple components are in the `seedu.brokeMan.commmon` package.

## implementation

### Entry

Entry class is the underlying superclass for Expense and Income classes. It establishes the common attributes and
methods that are necessary to represent Expenses and Incomes. Abstract class is used to represent their common features
to maximize code reusability and increase maintainability.

Private attributes

Info: String that stores the description of the entry

Amount: Double that stores the monetary value of entry

Time: LocalDateTime that stores the date and time of entry

Category: Category that stores the type tag of entry

**Methods**

Getters can be used to provide the private attributes to other classes

editDescription(), editAmount(), editTime(), editCategory()

* Takes in corresponding parameters to edit the private attributes.
* Used by EntryList to make edits

isSameMonth()

* Takes in Integer year and Month month and returns if the entry is made in the date specified by parameters.

### EntryList

The EntryList class represents a collection of Entry instances. It is an abstract class that serves as a superclass for
ExpenseList and IncomeList classes, providing common functionalities to minimize repetitive code and easing code
maintenance. It provides underlying methods for adding, removing, editing, and listing entries from the list, which can
be expenses or incomes depending on the subclass.

On top of the methods that provide basic functionality of expense/income lists, the EntryList class provides additional
methods such as summing all entries or filtering the entries according to LocalDate provided to the method. Most methods
of EntryList take in a List<Entry>, which is because it has to operate on a list of expenses or incomes passed by the
IncomeList or ExpenseList subclasses.

**Methods**

addEntry()

* Takes an Entry instance as a parameter and adds it to the class-level list

listEntry()

* Takes in a list of Entry and passes them to the UI to print to the user.
* Makes use of toString() method of entries.

deleteEntry()

* Takes in the list of entry and index of the entry to be deleted.
* The method acts as an underlying method for subclasses' deletion methods.

editEntry()

* Overloaded method. All methods take in the LinkedList of entries and the index of the entry that has to be edited.
  Another parameter has to be provided, which can be double, LocalDateTime, or String.
* additional parameter double edits the money amount of the entry in the list.
* additional parameter LocalDateTime edits the time when the entry is made.
* additional parameter String edits the description of the entry in the list.

getTotalAmount()

* Takes in a list of entries and returns the sum of all entry's monetary value.

SortEntryByAmount()

* Returns a sorted list of entry by amount of entry.

SortEntryByDate()

* Returns a sorted list of entry by date of entry.
  
findEntriesByCategory()
* Returns a list of entries with the same category and the total amount in this category.

### ExpenseList, IncomeList

Classes ExpenseList and IncomeList is responsible for keeping track of the corresponding entry instances added to the program by the user. 
At a class level, it keeps a **LinkedList** of corresponding entries. 
They both extend EntryList, the abstract class that represents a collection of Entry instances. 
It provides static functionalities of managing and viewing entry instances at a class level. 
Instances of ExpenseList and IncomeList are not created as all functionalities can be provided at the class level. 
  
**Methods**

listExpense() / listIncome()

* Overloaded method, may take it no parameter or LocalDate parameter
* If it has no passed parameters, it returns all entries in the list
* If a LocalDate is passed, it returns all entries made in the month specified by LocalDate instance.

### Budget

The Budget class represents the userâ€™s monthly budget. The class utilize class-level hashmaps to represent the monthly
budget, using outer key year and inner key month. It provides a method to set and view budget for different months.

It makes use of a static HashMap<Integer, HashMap<Month, Double>> to keep track of monthly budget. If the user tries to
access budget using keys that are not entered in the HashMap, it will return a warning mentioning that the inquired
budget has not been set yet.

### SaveExpense, SaveIncome

The SaveExpense and SaveIncome class deal with saving in the user inputted data locally so that it can be later accessed.
**Methods**

writeFile(LinkedList<Entry> expenses/incomes)
* writes to the file in a similar format that is entered in to make a new Expense object within the constructor.
*
readExpenseFile()

* This method reads in from the saved file either ExpenseData.txt or IncomeData.txt. Reads in and initialized each line as either expense or income. Then adds to the respective list.

## Appendix: Requirements

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- BrokeMan is suitable for students who have to work with tight budgets
- students who want to use their money efficiently
- students who want to minimize their spending.
- students who can type fast
- prefer typing to mouse interactions
- is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

- Manage income and expenses faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
- The program will offer visualization of the user's incomes, expenses and budget, allowing them to recap and be mindful
  about their financial status. The project will allow division of budget into multiple subcategories of expenses. In
  essence, the program sets students up for a better financial future.
